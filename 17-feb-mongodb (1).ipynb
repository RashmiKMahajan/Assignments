    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "non-relational databases:-\n",
    "A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored.\n",
    "NoSQL or non-relational databases examples: MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase and Apache HBase. They are best for Rapid Application Development. NoSQL is the best selection for flexible data storage with little to no structure limitations\n",
    "A relational database is structured, meaning the data is organized in tables. Many times, the data within these tables have relationships with one another, or dependencies. A non relational database is document-oriented, meaning, all information gets stored in more of a laundry list order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases:-\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases like MongoDB are a good choice when your data is document-centric and doesn't fit well into the schema of a relational database, when you need to accommodate massive scale, when you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases.\n",
    "MongoDB is best suitable for hierarchical data storage but RDBMS is not suitable for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "MongoDB supports JSON query language along with SQL but RDBMS supports SQL query language only. MongoDB is easy to set up, configure and run in comparison to the RDBMS.\n",
    "In comparison to the SQL server, MongoDB is faster and more scalable. While the SQL server supports JOIN and Global transactions, MongoDB does not. \n",
    "The MS SQL server does not accommodate large amounts of data, however MongoDB does.\n",
    "Flexibility: You can add new columns or fields on MongoDB without affecting existing rows or application performance. Not every database fits every business need. That's why many companies rely on both relational and non-relational databases for different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use cases for MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating large amounts of diverse data. ...\n",
    "Describing complex data structures that evolve. ...\n",
    "Delivering data in high-performance applications. ...\n",

    "1. Document Model\n",
    "MongoDB has been designed with developer productivity and flexibility in mind. It is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored as documents, and documents are grouped in collections. The document model is a lot more natural for developers to work with because documents are self-contained and can be treated as objects. This means that developers can focus on the data they need to store and process, rather than worrying about how to split the data across different rigid tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents are grouped together in collections. However, the documents in a single collection don't necessarily need to have exactly the same set of fields. This is what we call a “flexible schema.” This flexibility allows developers to iterate faster and migrate data between different schemas without any downtime. However, if you want to lock down your schema at a certain point, you can do so by applying validation rules to your collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents in MongoDB are stored in the BSON format, which is a binary-encoded JSON format. This means that the data is stored in a binary format, which is much faster than JSON. This also allows for the storage of binary data, which is useful for storing images, videos, and other binary data. Even though BSON is a binary-encoded format, it's easy to work with it using the MongoDB driver for your programming language."

    "2. Sharding\n",
    "Sharding is the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed instances, or “shards.” When applied to particularly large datasets, sharding helps the database distribute and better execute what might otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries. Without sharding, scaling a growing web application with millions of daily users is nearly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharding in MongoDB allows for much greater horizontal scalability. Horizontal scaling means that each shard in every cluster houses a portion of the dataset in question, essentially functioning as a separate database. Combining the data of the distributed shards forms a single, comprehensive database much better suited to handling the needs of a popular, growing application with zero downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "All client operations in a sharding environment are handled through a lightweight process called mongos. The mongos can direct queries to the correct shard based on the shard key. Proper sharding also contributes significantly to better load balancing."

    "3. Replication\n",
    "When your data only resides in a single server, it is exposed to multiple potential points of failure, such as a server crash, service interruptions, or even good old hardware failure. Any of these events would make accessing your data nearly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication allows you to sidestep these vulnerabilities by deploying multiple servers for disaster recovery and backup. Horizontal scaling across multiple servers greatly increases data availability, reliability, and fault tolerance. Potentially, replication can help spread the read load to the secondary members of the replica set with the use of read preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MongoDB, replica sets are employed for this purpose. A primary server or node accepts all write operations and applies those same operations across secondary servers, replicating the data. If the primary server should ever experience a critical failure, any one of the secondary servers can be elected to become the new primary node. And if the former primary node comes back online, it does so as a secondary server for the new primary node.\n",

    "7. Ad-Hoc Queries\n",
    "When designing the schema of a database, it is impossible to know in advance all the queries that will be performed by end users. An ad-hoc query is a short-lived command whose value depends on a variable. Each time an ad-hoc query is executed, the result may be different, depending on the variables in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing the way in which ad-hoc queries are handled can make a significant difference at scale, when thousands to millions of variables may need to be considered. This is why MongoDB, a document-oriented, flexible schema database, stands apart as the cloud database platform of choice for enterprise applications that require real-time analytics. With ad-hoc query support that allows developers to update ad-hoc queries in real time, the improvement in performance can be game-changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports field queries, geo queries, and regular expression searches. Queries can return specific fields and also account for user-defined functions. This is made possible with MongoDB indexes, BSON documents, and the MongoDB Query Language (MQL). MongoDB also supports aggregations via the Aggregation Framework."

    "8. Indexing\n",
    "In our experience, the number one issue that many technical support teams fail to address with their users is indexing. Done right, indexes are intended to improve search speed and performance. A failure to properly define appropriate indexes can and usually will lead to a myriad of accessibility issues, such as problems with query execution and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the right indexes, a database is forced to scan documents one by one to identify the ones that match the query statement. But if an appropriate index exists for each query, user requests can be optimally executed by the server. MongoDB offers a broad range of indexes and features with language-specific sort orders that support complex access patterns to datasets.\n",

    "At the end of the day, optimal load balancing remains one of the holy grails of large-scale database management for growing enterprise applications. Properly distributing millions of client requests to hundreds or thousands of servers can lead to a noticeable (and much appreciated) difference in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, via horizontal scaling features like replication and sharding, MongoDB supports large-scale load balancing. The platform can handle multiple concurrent read and write requests for the same data with best-in-class concurrency control and locking protocols that ensure data consistency. There’s no need to add an external load balancer—MongoDB ensures that each and every user has a consistent view and quality experience with the data they need to access."
