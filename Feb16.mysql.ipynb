    "1. It is RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)\t\n",
    "2. These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema\t\n",

    "6. Follows ACID property\t\n",
    "7. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS-SQL Server, etc\t\n",
    "When to Use SQL databases?\n",
    "SQL databases are cross-platform, more secure, free, and open source with better and stronger community support. These types of databases are a much better option when −\n",
    "1. Your primary focus is on data consistency, validity, and data integrity\n",
